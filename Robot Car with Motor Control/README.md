# Robot Car with Motor Control
The purpose of this project is to get some pratice with:
1) General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO).
2) Edge-triggered interrupts.
3) Hardware Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).
4) Phase-Locked Loop (PLL).
5) Power supply circuits.
6) DC Motors and motor drivers.

And to build a wheeled robot that changes its speed and direction according to the input switches on the Microcontorller.
