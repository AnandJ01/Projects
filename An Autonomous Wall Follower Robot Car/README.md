# An Autonomous Wall Follower Robot Car
The purpose of this project is to build an autonomous Wall Follower Robot Car using embedded systems basic hardware components including:
1) General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO).
2) Hardware Timer.
3) Interrupts.
4) Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)
5) Hardware Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM).
6) Switches.
7) LEDs.
8) DC Motors and motor drivers.
9) IR sensors and sensor drivers.
