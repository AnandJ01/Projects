# Traffic Light Controller
The objectives of this project are: 
1) Understanding and implementing of indexed data  structures.
2) Learning how to create a segmented software system. 
3) The study of real-time synchronization by designing a finite state machine controller.
4) Learn how to use a hardware timer. Software skills you will learn include defining data structure for FSM, building Moore FSM engine, creating fixed-time delays using the SysTick timer, and debugging real-time systems.
