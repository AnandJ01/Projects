# Drage Race Lights Controller
The purpose of this project is to combine the concepts of
• Interfacing to switches and LEDs.
• Using a Moore finite state machine (FSM).
• Using interrupts (GPIO and SysTick).
• Perform explicit measurements on the circuits to verify they are operational and improve understanding of how they work.
