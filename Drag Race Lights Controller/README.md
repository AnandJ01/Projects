# Drage Race Lights Controller
The purpose of this project is to combine the concepts of
1) Interfacing to switches and LEDs.
2) Using a Moore finite state machine (FSM).
3) Using interrupts (GPIO and SysTick).
4) Perform explicit measurements on the circuits to verify they are operational and improve understanding of how they work.
